# SecureNetScan
SecureNetScan is a PowerShell tool that scans network connections on a Windows system and provides detailed information about the connections established by various processes. It retrieves the process ID, process name, IP address, and ThreatFox result for each connection, indicating whether the IP address is considered secure or insecure. This tool enhances network security monitoring by helping users identify potential security risks and take appropriate actions. SecureNetScan leverages ThreatFox's threat intelligence to provide valuable insights into network connections and assist in maintaining a secure network environment.
