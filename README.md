**Tool Name: NetScanX with ThreatFox Integration**

**Description:**
NetScanX with ThreatFox Integration is a PowerShell tool designed to scan network connections on a Windows system and provide information about the connections, including IP addresses, process IDs, process names, and ThreatFox results. By leveraging the ThreatFox API, this tool helps identify potentially insecure connections by querying a threat intelligence platform.

**How to Use:**

1. Ensure that you have PowerShell installed on your Windows system. This tool is designed to work specifically with PowerShell.
1. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute PowerShell scripts on your system.
1. Download or clone the NetScanX repository from GitHub to your local machine.
1. Open PowerShell and navigate to the directory where you saved the NetScanX script.
1. Run the following command to import the required module:
   ````
   Import-Module NetTCPIP
   ```
   ````
1. Run the NetScanX script by executing the following command:
   ```
   .\NetScanX.ps1
   ```
1. The tool will start scanning the network connections on your system, excluding loopback IP addresses.
1. For each connection, it will query the ThreatFox API to determine if the IP address is considered secure or insecure based on threat intelligence.
1. Once the scan is complete, the tool will display a table with the results, including IP addresses, ThreatFox results (secure or insecure), process IDs, and process names.
1. Review the results to identify any potentially insecure connections.
1. If any insecure connections are found, take appropriate actions to mitigate the associated security risks.
1. If no insecure connections are found, the tool will display a message stating "No insecure connections found."

Please note:

- Ensure your system has an active internet connection for the ThreatFox API queries to function properly.
- It's important to have an understanding of the potential risks associated with network connections and the implications of the ThreatFox results.
- This tool provides insights based on the ThreatFox threat intelligence platform. It's recommended to complement the results with other security measures and best practices.
